# Hi there!
I'm glad you found your way to my GitHub profile  

My name in Helena Johansson and I'm enjoing life as a software developer to be.  
I am currently working my way through a [Full Stack Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course at **Code Institute**, Ireland.  
I live in Lidköping, Sweden, with my family of five, and work as a Mechanical Engineer.  
So, quite busy splitting my time between work, studies and family, and my two major hobbies, horse back riding and dog training.  

I am quite proud of my Tech journey so far. If you like, please have a look at the repos below.  
The first four are my portfolio projects in the Code Institute programme.  
The last three are from the three hackathons I've joined so far.  

There will be more of both of them!  

### My Portfolio Projects at Code Institute
Here you find live links to my projects: 
- My first project, HTML/CSS:
[Dixie's Doggy Daycare](https://odden69.github.io/dixies_doggy_daycare/)  
(Unfortunately I got an CORS error to font awsome, and since I am not allowed to make any changes to my projects until the course is finished I had to make a copy of the repo to fix it. Here is a link to a copy of the deployed site: [Corrected Dixie's Doggy Daycare](https://odden69.github.io/fixing_dixies_doggy_daycare/))
- My second project, Vanila JavaScript:
[Memory Game](https://odden69.github.io/memory-game/)
- My third project, pure Python (the command line UI was provided by CI):
[Nonogram Game](https://hj-nonogram-game.herokuapp.com/)
- My fourth project, a full stack website built on Django:
[ITrain](https://hj-itrain.herokuapp.com/)
