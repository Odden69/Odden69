### Hi there!
I'm glad you found your way to my GitHub profile  

My name in Helena Johansson and I'm enjoing life as a software developer to be.  
I am going through a [Full Stack Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course at **Code Institute**, Ireland.  
I live in Lidk√∂ping, Sweden, with my family of five, and work as a Mechanical Engineer.  
So, quite busy splitting my time between work, studies and family, and my two major hobbies, horse back riding and dog training.  

I am quite proud of my Tech journey so far. If you like, please have a look at the repos below.  
The first three are my portfolio projects in the Code Institute programme.  
The last three are from the three hackathons I've joined so far.  

There will be more of both of them!  

Here you find live links to my projects: 
- My first project, HTML/CSS:
[Dixie's Doggy Daycare](https://odden69.github.io/dixies_doggy_daycare/)
- My second project, Vanila JavaScript:
[Memory Game](https://odden69.github.io/memory-game/)
- My third project, pure Python(the command line UI was provided by CI):
[Nonogram Game](https://hj-nonogram-game.herokuapp.com/)
- Currently working on planning the forth project

And here to the Hackathon projects where I participated:
